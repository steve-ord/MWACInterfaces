 * @brief: Simple class to act as a daemon and handle incoming connections
 * 
 * The connection handler is launched by the MWAC correlator and listens on 
 * a socket for incoming connections. 
 * 
 * It passes the data onto an interface which places the data into correlator 
 * memory and manages synchronisation
 *
